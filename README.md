# Dogs-vs-Cats-Kaggle

A solution for the Dogs vs Cats classification problem on Kaggle

Pets are an integral part of both our society and our well-being. Frequently proclaimed as Human's best friend, we all love our dogs and would do pretty much anything for them. 
While cats err on the more royal side of the equation, they might not be as expressive of their emotions but they certainly capture our hearts like no other. 

But while we may be able to differentiate what our dog looks like from our cat or any cat for that matter, we can help our technology the same with the help of a bit of Neural Network's magic, while at the same time exploring how such classifiers can help us in the real world scenario. 
Identification of dogs and cats can help us with simple recognition, being able to further map the points on their faces to generate filters and other impressive tidbits that can be utilized in many different ways such as the Snapchat pet filter, or maybe even automated cat/dog doors for letting our favourite pets back inside after a long day of exploration in the garden. The basis may be small but the possibilites are endless.
